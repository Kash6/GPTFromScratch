✅ 1. Simplified Sequence Formatting
Combined prompt and target into a single sequence:
"123+456=975" (with 975 reversed as 579)

Removed separate masking logic (y = -1) — instead, used a causal LM setup where the model learns to predict the next token in the full sequence.

✅ 2. Fixed Data Encoding + Target Shift
Instead of separately encoding x and y, we now:

Encode the entire sequence

Use x[:, :-1] as input and x[:, 1:] as target
This ensures proper next-token prediction across the full problem and answer.

✅ 3. Removed Problematic Loss Masking
No more -1 in targets and no ignore_index needed.

Clean and standard causal LM loss:

python
Copy
Edit
loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.view(-1, vocab_size), targets.view(-1))
✅ 4. Sampling Tweaks
Replaced greedy decoding with multinomial sampling for diversity.

Trimmed output only after the = symbol to extract the generated reversed sum.

✅ 5. Position Embedding & block_size Fix
Ensured position_embedding_table has enough capacity.

Set block_size = len(full sequence) = DIGITS*2 + 2 + DIGITS + 1 (for a+b=+sum)
